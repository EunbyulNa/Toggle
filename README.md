# Toggle

# 1. How it works 
Click each titles, contents are shown, and hidden

# 2. What I learned 
I made four buttons, and seperate div under the buttons, when I clicked each buttons, div has toggle class list

-currentTarget : The current target event property returns the element whose event listeners triggered
I used it when I made filter project, and I used it again so I fully understand what concept is

-nextElementSibling : I learned about DOM tree, I only knew about parentElement, childElement. But from this project I could learn next 
ElementSibling property which returns the next element in the same tree level. 

-classList, toggle() : Toggle between adding and removing a class name
